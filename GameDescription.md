**Game Title:** "Waiting Room Simulator"

**Concept:**
The game is set entirely in a drab, poorly lit waiting room. The player takes on the role of a character who is waiting for an indeterminate appointment that never actually happens.

**Gameplay Features:**

1. **Endless Waiting:**
   - The game has no real objective other than to wait. There are no quests, no combat, and no puzzles. The player simply sits in the waiting room, waiting for something that never comes.

2. **Monotonous Activities:**
   - The player can choose from a limited set of activities to pass the time, such as reading outdated magazines, staring at a broken TV, or listening to the same three songs on a loop from a tinny radio.

3. **Annoying NPCs:**
   - Other characters in the waiting room engage in irritating behaviors, such as talking loudly on their phones, sneezing constantly, or fidgeting noisily. Interaction with them is limited and always unproductive.

4. **Drab Environment:**
   - The graphics are intentionally dull, with muted colors and low detail. The environment never changes, no matter how long the player waits.

5. **No Progression:**
   - There are no levels, no skill trees, and no upgrades. The game starts and ends in the same waiting room, with no sense of progression or achievement.

6. **Mind-Numbing Mini-Games:**
   - Occasionally, the player can engage in simple, repetitive mini-games like sorting through old paperwork or untangling a mess of phone cords. These mini-games are designed to be tedious and unrewarding.

7. **Pointless Notifications:**
   - The game regularly provides useless updates, such as "The doctor will see you soon," which never actually lead to any progression.

8. **Real-Time Clock:**
   - The game operates in real-time, meaning a minute in the game is a minute in real life. This extends the feeling of endless waiting and frustration.

**Objective:**
To endure as long as possible without quitting out of sheer boredom or frustration. There is no winning or end goal, making the entire experience futile.

**Why Itâ€™s the Worst:**
"Waiting Room Simulator" combines all the elements of a dull, frustrating, and pointless experience into one game, offering no real entertainment value or sense of achievement, making it the epitome of a bad video game.

**How it works:**
It's a 2D game, with 8-bit graphics that allows you to traverse around the waiting room which is just a square, roughly 100x the size of the main character. The other NPC will randomly traverse the same waiting room, and when you bump into them, they will exhibit one of their annoying chacteristics.
